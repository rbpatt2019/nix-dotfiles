Additional plugin files

Stores additional files needed for proper plugin application

Catppuccin
==========

Currently. the only files present are for catppuccin/tmux to add support for mode
indicator and wifi status. There are upstream MRs open for both, and these files will
not be necessary once a new release for it and the relevant nix package are performed.
